summary: "Negative psychological outcomes experienced by forensic interviewers can be explained by the emotional labor they engage in. Under an ethic of care, it would be unethical to require emotional labor in forensic interviewing and not equip workers with the skills to do it."
abstract: "The purpose of this paper is to reframe child forensic interviewing in terms of emotional labor. Child forensic interviewing practice illustrates a public service function that demands emotional labor yet fails to empower its workers with skills to preserve their personal wellbeing. Under an ethic of care, public servants are not the means to organizational ends. Failing to articulate emotional labor demands fosters occupational stress and burnout. While many studies examine negative psychological outcomes from public service work, few examine the impact on childrenâ€™s services workers, and even fewer explore emotional labor as a mechanism through which negative outcomes arise."

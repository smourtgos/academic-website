summary: 'Between 2022 and 2024, seven U.S. states banned deceptive interrogation tactics for juveniles. Using NIBRS data on 510,582 juvenile incidents, we find no pooled national effect on case clearance rates---but substantial heterogeneity across states that is systematically related to legislative design.'

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Between 2022 and 2024, seven U.S. states—Illinois, Oregon, Utah, Delaware, Nevada, Indiana, and Colorado—enacted legislation restricting or prohibiting law enforcement from using deceptive interrogation tactics when questioning juvenile suspects. A central policy concern is whether these restrictions reduce case clearance rates.</p>
<p>Using National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data covering <strong>510,582 juvenile incidents</strong> from 2021 through 2024, we employ a staggered difference-in-differences design with 44 never-treated control states to estimate the causal effects of these bans on arrest clearance rates, exceptional clearance rates, and overall case clearance rates.</p>
</div>
<div id="key-finding" class="section level2">
<h2>Key Finding</h2>
<p><strong>The pooled national effect is null.</strong> Randomization inference yields p = 0.558 for arrest clearance and p = 0.906 for any clearance. However, the null average masks substantial heterogeneity: Oregon’s any-clearance rate <em>increased</em> by 4.4 percentage points (p &lt; 0.001) while Colorado’s <em>decreased</em> by 2.1 pp (p = 0.003). This heterogeneity is systematically related to legislative design—Oregon has the strongest evidentiary standard (clear and convincing), while Colorado has the broadest definition with additional compliance mandates.</p>

<h2>Methods Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Estimators</strong>: Two-way fixed effects DiD (state-by-state), Sun &amp; Abraham (2021) interaction-weighted estimator, Callaway &amp; Sant’Anna (2021) group-time ATTs, randomization inference (500 permutations), and Bayesian multilevel binomial models (brms/cmdstanr)</li>
<li><strong>Outcomes</strong>: Arrest clearance rate, exceptional clearance rate, any clearance rate (constructed from NIBRS administrative and arrestee segments)</li>
<li><strong>Robustness</strong>: Placebo-in-time tests, pre-trends validation, offense-specific estimation, agency-level ATT distributions, incident volume composition checks</li>
</ul>

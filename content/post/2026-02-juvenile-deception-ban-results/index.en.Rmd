summary: 'Between 2022 and 2024, seven U.S. states banned deceptive interrogation tactics for juveniles. Using NIBRS data on 510,582 juvenile incidents, we find no pooled national effect on case clearance rates---but substantial heterogeneity across states that is systematically related to legislative design.'

## Overview

Between 2022 and 2024, seven U.S. states---Illinois, Oregon, Utah, Delaware, Nevada, Indiana, and Colorado---enacted legislation restricting or prohibiting law enforcement from using deceptive interrogation tactics when questioning juvenile suspects. A central policy concern is whether these restrictions reduce case clearance rates.

Using National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data covering **510,582 juvenile incidents** from 2021 through 2024, we employ a staggered difference-in-differences design with 44 never-treated control states to estimate the causal effects of these bans on arrest clearance rates, exceptional clearance rates, and overall case clearance rates.

## Key Finding

**The pooled national effect is null.** Randomization inference yields p = 0.558 for arrest clearance and p = 0.906 for any clearance. However, the null average masks substantial heterogeneity: Oregon's any-clearance rate *increased* by 4.4 percentage points (p < 0.001) while Colorado's *decreased* by 2.1 pp (p = 0.003). This heterogeneity is systematically related to legislative design---Oregon has the strongest evidentiary standard (clear and convincing), while Colorado has the broadest definition with additional compliance mandates.

## Interactive Dashboard

The full results---including state-by-state DiD estimates, distributed lag dynamics, offense-specific effects, exceptional clearance subcategory analysis, sex crime deep dives, Bayesian multilevel models, agency-level heterogeneity, and robustness checks---are available in an interactive dashboard.

The dashboard allows you to explore all results interactively---filter tables, hover over plots for detailed estimates, and compare across states and outcome measures.

## Methods Summary

- **Estimators**: Two-way fixed effects DiD (state-by-state), Sun & Abraham (2021) interaction-weighted estimator, Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021) group-time ATTs, randomization inference (500 permutations), and Bayesian multilevel binomial models (brms/cmdstanr)
- **Outcomes**: Arrest clearance rate, exceptional clearance rate, any clearance rate (constructed from NIBRS administrative and arrestee segments)
- **Robustness**: Placebo-in-time tests, pre-trends validation, offense-specific estimation, agency-level ATT distributions, incident volume composition checks

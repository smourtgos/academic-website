abstract: "Improving police response to sexual assault victims remains an important priority for law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. We evaluate a brief, evidence-based training program designed to improve victim engagement and officer response in rape investigations. Using a longitudinal research design, we find that the training significantly improved officer knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy regarding sexual assault investigations."

abstract: "Police agencies typically construct and teach their force policies in an ordinal manner, reflecting an assumption that the varying types of force exist on a continuum. This study challenges that assumption by examining the effect of different use-of-force techniques on public perceptions of police use-of-force. Utilizing a framing experiment with a nationally representative sample, we find that respondents do not perceive police use-of-force in an ordinal manner. Implications for police policy and training are discussed."

summary: "Job functions best explain activations of police BWCs. Officers with sharper levels of concern that BWCs reduce their professional discretion, or expose them to public hatred and outrage, are likely to activate BWCs less often. Nearly two-thirds of officers in this study's sample activated their cameras more often than predicted by the best performing model. This indicates that BWC policy effectively sets a 'floor' of minimum activation standards and that overall, officers will record more often than required."
abstract: "Administrative discretion can range from benign to troubling, and law enforcement officers possess the power to use physical violence in the discharge of their duties. Body-worn cameras (BWCs) are a workplace surveillance technology intended to monitor officer behavior in the field, but officers exercise discretion over whether or not to activate their cameras. So, what drives officers to activate BWCs? Combining unique survey and administrative data, three competing explanations of BWC activation are compared in one department: Officer demographics, job function, and attitudes. Job function covariates offer robust predictive power of BWC activation frequency. Demographics do not predict BWC activations except rank, which negatively correlates with activation. Though the bulk of attitudinal measures do not predict BWC activations, negative relationships are noted with how officers perceive BWCs to impact their professional discretion, and their belief that cameras expose officers to public outrage and disapproval."

abstract: "COVID-19 has critically affected law enforcement agencies, with officer infections and quarantines undermining departments' ability to serve the public. We use Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) modeling to assess the effect of a police department's COVID-19 vaccine distribution program on officer infections. We find the vaccine distribution program led to a statistically significant decrease in officer infections, effectively eliminating COVID-19 infections in the department's workforce."

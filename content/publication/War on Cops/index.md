abstract: "The police murder of George Floyd sparked nationwide protests in the summer
  of 2020 and revived claims that public outcry over such high-profile police killings
  perpetuated a violent “war on cops.” Using data collected by the Gun Violence Archive
  (GVA) on firearm assaults of U.S. police officers, we use Bayesian structural time
  series (BSTS) modeling to empirically assess if and how patterns of firearm assault
  on police officers in the United States were influenced by the police murder of
  George Floyd. Our analysis finds that the murder of George Floyd was associated
  with a 3-week spike in firearm assaults on police, after which the trend in firearms
  assaults dropped to levels only slightly above that which were predicted by pre-Floyd
  data. We discuss potential explanations for these findings and consider their relevance
  to the contemporary discussion of a “war on cops,” violence, and officer safety."

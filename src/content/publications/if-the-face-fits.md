abstract: "Can police cadets' facial traits predict whether they will be promoted in their careers? Using archival photographs of police cadets and machine learning-based facial analysis, we examine whether perceived facial traits (competence, dominance, attractiveness, trustworthiness) are associated with future career advancement. Our results suggest that perceived facial competence, but not other traits, is positively associated with promotion."

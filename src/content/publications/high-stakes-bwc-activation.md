abstract: "Body-worn cameras (BWCs) are a high-profile public administration tool with significant implications for government accountability, transparency, and public trust. Despite their importance, we know very little about what drives the administrative decisions to activate (or not activate) these devices in the field. This study addresses this gap by examining the factors associated with BWC activation decisions among police officers."
